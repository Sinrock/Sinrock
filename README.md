### Hello, & welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

 I am a curious and creative full stack software engineer with a passion for software design and implementation that helps people. Participating in the RubyForGood charity has helped me realize that I want to do more to design solutions to make the world a bit better. Drafts software requirements and executes testing and software delivery support. I apply the same dedication and determination to software development that I used in the US. Navy as an aviation electronics technician. I am excited to use my Flatiron honed coding skills to have some fun coding and to do some good in the world!
